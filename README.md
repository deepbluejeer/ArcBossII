Game created for LudumDare 41

This game was developed in three days during the GameJam Ludum Dare. 

The theme was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres" - I combined two different artstyles, 2D and 3D.

I did everything alone, except for the music which I took from Newgrounds.

This was my first serious attempt at implementing the concepts I learned from reading the book "programming game AI by example". I used Action Delegate and interfaces to create the enemies AI. This way I could focus on creating independent methods to each enemy state, making it easier to program and debug. This helped me finish the game sooner so I could focus on the graphics.
